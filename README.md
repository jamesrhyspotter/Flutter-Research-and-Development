# Flutter Mastery

This is a sandbox for Flutter components and developing my flutter skills. 

This will be used to build new widgets and components, as well as complex logic for various apps that can be replicated. 

The intention of this repo is to showcase my expertise in flutter, develop a repo that can be used as a reference for future projects, and to develop my skills in flutter.

This repo will contain a variety of custom widgets, as well as leveraging various APIs and technologies seen in professional projects such that I can demonstrate how I can build complex applications.
